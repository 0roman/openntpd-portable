For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.

2015-03-24  OpenNTPD 5.7p4
	* Added support for HTTPS constraints to validate NTP responses.
	  See the man page and example config file for how to configure it.
	  The initial announcement:
	  http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142356166731390&w=2 is an
	  explanation of the rationale and how the feature works.
	* Workaround an apparent bug in Solaris adjtime that cause the clock
	  to report sync/unsync continuously.
	* Workaround an issue on systems with 32-bit time_t that causes an
	  overflow if the system time is later than early 2036.

	The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.1.4 or later, is
	required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
	required to use OpenNTPD.

2015-01-27  OpenNTPD 5.7p3
	* Fixed issue resolving hostnames when the network is initially
	  unavailable.
	* Fixed process name logging on Linux and OS X.
	* Fixed adjfreq failures on Solaris due to uninitialized struct timex.
	* Support building on Linux musl libc.
	* Default privilege separation directory changed from /var/empty/ntp
	  to /var/empty. Please ensure that if you are using the default from
	  previous releases that the privsep directory is empty, owned by
	  root, and has no write privileges for other users.

2015-01-20  OpenNTPD 5.7p2

	* Switched the drift file from an unscaled frequency offset to ppm.
	  The latter format is compatible with that of ntp.org.  This allows
	  easy switching between ntpd daemons
	* Fixed a memory leak in DNS lookups.
	* Added support for setting the process title on Linux and OS X.
	  The different processes are now possible to tell apart by role in
	  the process list.
	* Import NetBSD support.
	* Various bugfixes and refinements from the community.

2015-01-08  OpenNTPD 5.7p1

	* Support for a new build infrastructure based on the LibreSSL
	  framework. Source code is integrated directly from the OpenBSD tree
	  with few manual changes, easing maintenance.
	* Removed support for several OSes pending test reports and updated
	  portability code.
	* Supports the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4 as described in
	  RFC 5905
	* Added route virtualization (rdomain) support.
	* Added ntpctl(8), which allows for querying ntpd(8) at runtime.
	* Finer-grained clock adjustment via adjfreq / ntp_adjtime where
	  available.
	* Improved latency on heavily-loaded machines.
