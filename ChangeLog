2015-01-27  OpenNTPD 5.7p3
	* Fixed issue resolving hostnames when the network is initially
	  unavailable.
	* Fixed process name logging on Linux and OS X.
	* Fixed adjfreq failures on Solaris due to uninitialized struct timex.
	* Support building on Linux musl libc.
	* Default privilege separation directory changed from /var/empty/ntp
	  to /var/empty. Please ensure that if you are using the default from
	  previous releases that the privsep directory is empty, owned by
	  root, and has no write privileges for other users.

2015-01-20  OpenNTPD 5.7p2

	* Switched the drift file from an unscaled frequency offset to ppm.
	  The latter format is compatible with that of ntp.org.  This allows
	  easy switching between ntpd daemons
	* Fixed a memory leak in DNS lookups.
	* Added support for setting the process title on Linux and OS X.
	  The different processes are now possible to tell apart by role in
	  the process list.
	* Import NetBSD support.
	* Various bugfixes and refinements from the community.

2015-01-08  OpenNTPD 5.7p1

	* Support for a new build infrastructure based on the LibreSSL
	  framework. Source code is integrated directly from the OpenBSD tree
	  with few manual changes, easing maintenance.
	* Removed support for several OSes pending test reports and updated
	  portability code.
	* Supports the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4 as described in
	  RFC 5905
	* Added route virtualization (rdomain) support.
	* Added ntpctl(8), which allows for querying ntpd(8) at runtime.
	* Finer-grained clock adjustment via adjfreq / ntp_adjtime where
	  available.
	* Improved latency on heavily-loaded machines.
