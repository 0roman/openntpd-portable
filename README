This is a new port of OpenBSD's native ntpd to other Unix flavours adding
autoconf support and the necessary compatibility layer.  It is based on
portability code from the OpenSSH and LibreSSL portable projects.

OpenNTPD has a web site at http://www.openntpd.org/

The current portable tree can be found at https://github.com/openntpd-portable

Credits
-------
OpenBSD's native ntpd was written by Henning Brauer and Alexander Guy.

Portable OpenNTPD versions 3.9 and earlier were developed by Darren Tucker,
with contributions from Christian Weisgerber, Jason Mader and Anthony
O.Zabelin., and were based heavily on OpenSSH portable.

This new portable version is based on the LibreSSL portable framework by Brent
Cook. It includes patches from FreeBSD, Debian and Gentoo OpenNTPD packages,
along with with compatibility code from the OpenSSH and original OpenNTPD
portable trees.

Platform Requirements
---------------------
adjtime() and settimeofday() syscalls or equivalent.
a working arc4random implementation, OpenSSL or LibreSSL
 (this project shares the same arc4random compatibility code from LibreSSL)

At the time of writing the Portable version is known to build and work on:

 - OpenBSD (5.6)
 - Linux (Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04)
 - FreeBSD (9.x, 10.x)
 - Solaris (10.x, 11.x)
 - Mac OS X (10.9)

It may work on others operating systems, newer and older, but it's still a work
in progress.  Reports (success or otherwise) and/or diffs welcome.
